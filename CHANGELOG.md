## [1.0.11] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- The x-cloak style is output in the page head instead of at the end of the body, so cloaked Alpine.js elements are hidden before they are first painted.
- Stores > Configuration > Performance Optimizer no longer shows the Defer Third-Party Scripts and Excluded Domains settings, which had no effect; saved values are ignored.
